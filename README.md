# OS Project

This project is based on a small OS in this book <<[Orange'S:一个操作系统的实现](https://book.douban.com/subject/3735649/)>>, which you can refer to for environment setup. The main features and functions we added above ORANGE OS are:

- Add `scanf` lib fucntion support, ORANGE seems to only support `printf`.
- Implement a naive multi-priority-queue scheduling algorithm I learned in OSTEP. But honestly, it's kind of slower than the original algorithm.
- Add a *fake multi-level* file system, the code is only available in `final` branch.
- Add some command line games.

## QuickStart

After environment setup, you can

```shell
    ./run.sh
```
